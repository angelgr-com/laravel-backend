Complete backend for the development of a LFG (Looking For Group) web application.

The objective is to develop with the PHP Laravel Framework a REST API (an Application Programming Interface following the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style).

## Application requirements

- üÜó Users must be able to register to the application, by establishing a username/password.
- ‚úÖ Users must be able to authenticate themselves to the application by logging in
- üÜï Users have to be able to create groups (parties) for a given videogame.
- üîé Users must be able to search for groups (parties) by selecting a videogame.
- üë©‚Äçüíª Users must be able to join and leave a Party.
- üó® Users must be able to send messages to the Party. These messages must be able to be edited and deleted by their originating user.
- üí¨ Messages existing in a Party must be displayed as a common chat.
- üìã Users can enter and modify their profile data, e.g. their Steam user.
- üëã Users must be able to log out of the web application.

## Technologies

Technologies used for the development of the API:

- **Laravel**. A MVC PHP framework. 
- **Laravel/Passport** for API authentication using JWT (JSON Web Token).
- **SQL**:
  - **Eloquent**, an object-relational mapper (ORM) to interact with the database.
  - **Laravel's database Query Builder**, an interface to creating and running database queries.
- **Git-Flow**, used to code by creating a branch for each feature.
- **Heroku** to upload the app to production.

## Database model

The database uses several schemas to store the application information. The data model used:

## How to use

### Online

The API is deployed in Heroku so to test the endpoints it is only necessary to use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), [Thunder](https://www.thunderclient.com/) or [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).

By downloading the following files, it is possible to import the endpoints into Postman with a set of requests ready to test endpoints:

- Users (players):
  - [1_laravel-backend_players.postman_collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelgr-com/laravel-backend/main/assets/postman/1_laravel-backend_players.postman_collection.json)
- Games:
  - [2_laravel-backend_games.postman_collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelgr-com/laravel-backend/main/assets/postman/2_laravel-backend_games.postman_collection.json)
- Parties:
  - [3_laravel-backend_parties.postman_collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelgr-com/laravel-backend/main/assets/postman/3_laravel-backend_parties.postman_collection.json)
- Messages:
  - [4_laravel-backend_messages.postman_collection.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angelgr-com/laravel-backend/main/assets/postman/4_laravel-backend_messages.postman_collection.json)

### Local

- Clone or [download](https://github.com/angelgr-com/laravel-backend/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) this repository.

- With [PHP](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) installed, it is possible to install [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/installation) by using Composer:

  ```bash
  composer global require laravel/installer
  ```

- Open the repository folder and install dependencies:

  ```
  cd laravel-backend
  composer install
  ```

- Create a new empty local schema.

- Create a .env file and enter the database configuration using environment variables:

  ```
  DB_CONNECTION=mysql
  DB_HOST=
  DB_PORT=
  DB_DATABASE=
  DB_USERNAME=
  DB_PASSWORD=
  ```

- Run database migrations and seeders:

  ```
  php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
  ```

- Start the server:

  ```
  php artisan serve
  ```
